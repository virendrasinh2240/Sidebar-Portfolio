                    2) What are the prerequisites of being a web developer?
                    <div class="box2">

                        A beginner web developer is expected to have a fundamental knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript,
                        and other aspects like jQuery, SQL, and some other scripting languages. An experienced web
                        developer is expected to have all the given aspects and great knowledge of design patterns.

                    7) How to integrate different stylesheets into a website?

                    <div class="box2">

                        It depends on the factor of how the site is laid out. However, for the most efficient
                        performance, one file can be used with styles.css. If you want to change any style, open up the
                        styles.css file, and in the relevant section, you can modify CSS. You can also link your HTML
                        file through the below command.

                    9) What is the correct way to include JavaScript into your HTML?
                    <div class="box2">

                        The most effective way to include JavaScript in your HTML is by referring to event handlers or
                        including inline code.

                    <div class="box2">


                        There are usually three types of boxes available in JavaScript. They are:

                        ALERT displays a message with an OK button.

                        CONFIRM: displays a confirmation window with OK and Cancel buttons.

                        PROMPT: displays a pop-up dialog box seeking user inputs followed by confirmation buttons.

                    11) Define Scope in JavaScript and name different types of Scopes.
                    <div class="box2">


                        The scope is usually defined to felicitate the accessibility of variables and methods(functions)
                        in applications. There are two types of Scopes in JavaScript: Local and Global.

                    12) What is the difference between '==' and '===' operators?
                    <div class="box2">


                        Although both of the operators belong to the comparison operator category, the '==' operator
                        checks the given values, whereas the '===' behaves like an equality operator and checks both the
                        value and their type.

                            <div class="box2">


                                With frames, you can display more than one document in the browser window. Also, the
                                <frame> tag can be used to declare a separate window within a frameset.

                                    With division, you can define a section in an HTML document and block elements
                                    within certain formats and styles. Division can serve local content, although the
                                    content is not independent of the page constituent.

                        17) What is Document Object Model (DOM)?
                        <div class="box2">



                            DOM is defined as the interface channeling cross-platform programming and is primarily used
                            to represent HTML and XML documents in nodes and objects. In simple words, DOM defines the
                            way of manipulating the logical structure of the documents and how they are accessed. It can
                            enable developers to modify, create, or remove the document structure, content, and style
                            used.

                            Moreover, whenever a document is displayed in the browser, it contains the combined style
                            because it automatically converts the styling components like CSS into DOM. The DOM combines
                            these styling components in the content of the document.

                        <div class="box2">

                            W3C abbreviates for World Web Consortium. It is an international community of developers and
                            teams that emphasize standardizing, correcting, and developing the web across global users
                            and defining best practices. The World Wide Web (WWW) is a standard set by W3C and has
                            different member organizations that control it through various IT-related projects. W3C is
                            considered important because it leads the World Wide Web to its greatest potential and
                            ensures its growth in the long term.

                            Moreover, W3C mainly focuses on developing certain constraints and guidelines for critical
                            web assets like HTML and CSS programming. It also focuses on XML technology, web devices,
                            authority tools, and web browsing experience. It helps web developers to write scalable code
                            and run it everywhere. A web developer is expected to enforce these open standards to ensure
                            that web content is accessible to all audiences globally and delivers a great user
                            experience.

                        <div class="box2">
                            Responsive web design is generally a concept of creating web pages that can be easily scaled
                            across various resolutions without losing any information or screen tearing. The main
                            concept of responsive web design is to deliver the structure of the web page that can be
                            automatically adjusted across various platforms and devices with an optimal viewing
                            experience.

                            There are mainly three types of CSS used: They are:
                            Inline CSS: Supports additional CSS inline with HTML elements grouped.

                            External CSS: Used to import an external CSS file to the current HTML document.

                            Embedded or internal CSS: Uses attribute to style tag add CSS styles.

                        <div class="box2">


                            The selector in CSS is used in styling with the rule of the inline elements. It is easy to
                            choose and select HTML elements with selector usage based on factors including attributes,
                            ID, and name.

                            The CSS box model components represent an entity under which HTML content is enclosed, like
                            a box or a button element. Some of its components are:

                            Border: Denotes the content and padding around borders.
                            Content: Focuses on the actual displaying content.
